          You can zoom in and out on the grid editor. If you add many rows, you lose the context of how the grid would look. Zoom makes it easy to see the maximum number of rows possible. This zoom should only be done on the editor area and not on the entire page, so you **cannot** use the native browser zoom.

          In addition to seeing the name, users must see from the application how the alignment would look according to the template they have selected. In other words, if the right-alignment template is selected, the products must be aligned to the right in the editor.
